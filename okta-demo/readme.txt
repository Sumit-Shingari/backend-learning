This project has been created by Sumit Shingari for learning purpose.

Basic Outline
#####################################################################
This project demonstrate a working example on how to use spring security + oauth authnetication in your project. In my case I have used okta as an third party implementation for oauth2.
 
This project demostarte how we can provide third party authentication, freeing up the project server from handling authentication.

Here I have used developer okta account, created an application to get issuer, client id and secret.

Further I have also created an admin group ( workds as role ) and also a custom scope to test authentication.

This is the basic project making use of okta.
